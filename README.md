# This is a simple full stack CRUD To-Do list application

# The technologies I am using are NodeJS and the Express framework for the back-end, handlebars for the templating engine, MySQL for the database, Sequelize as the ORM, and Bootstrap for the front-end

# The purpose of this application is to further demonstrate and practice some of the concepts and technologies I have learned in the KU coding bootcamp
